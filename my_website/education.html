                I started attending <strong><a href="https://www.srisbn.edu.my/" target="_blank">Sekolah Sri Seremban </strong></a> when I was six years old. The school includes three levels which are the preschool, primary, and secondary. The secondary school's name is SMI Seri Setia Seremban. 
                I graduated from Form 5 in 2021, and I also took the SPM exam there. Now, I am recently a diploma student in Information Management in UiTM Rembau and this semester is my last semester here. 
                I have always been interested in technology. I recently completed my industrial training at <strong><a href="https://jheains.ns.gov.my/" target="_blank">Jabatan Hal Ehwal Agama Islam (JHEAINS)</strong></a>, 
                where I worked in both the human resources and ICT units. When I was there, the staff were very kind and fun. They always treadted me kindly, sometimes gave a free food for me and the other practical intern there. </p>
