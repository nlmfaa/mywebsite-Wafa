Spider-Man is a superhero in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist 
Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. 
He has been featured in comic books, television shows, films, video games, novels, and plays.
Spider-Man is secret identity of Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter was depicted as a teenage high-school student and an orphan raised by 
his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents, Richard and Mary Parker, died in a plane crash. Lee, Ditko, and later creators had the character deal with 
the struggles of adolescence and young adulthood and gave him many supporting characters, such as
Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson,
and the Black Cat; and enemies such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story,
Peter gets his superhuman spider powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.

Sometimes student, sometimes scientist and sometimes photographer, Peter Parker is a full-time super hero better known as the web-slinging and wall-crawling Spider-Man.
As an orphaned child, Peter was raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. At a science expo, Peter was bitten by an errant radioactive spider which granted 
him an array of arachnid powers. He initially became Spider-Man to use his powers as an entertainer, growing so conceited he didn't bother stopping a passerby 
burglar. In a twist of fate, the same burglar wound up killing Peter's Uncle Ben, leading him to realize that he needed to use his powers responsibly.[10] 
From then on, Spider-Man became a crime-fighting vigilante.[127]
